# HTML-and-CSS-assigment
our assignment is to build two basic HTML structured pages. First is Index page that will greet the
visitors and present some articles and a bit of statistics on the side.
Second is a Login page that gives the user a form to fil in to sign in with (fake, no login service).
Only make the HTML elements and their contents, you are not allowed to use styling in this
assignment (only exception is setting the size of images).
Refer to resources for information on how to implement the required features.
